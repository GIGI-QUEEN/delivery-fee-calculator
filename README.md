# Delivery Fee Calculator

Delivery fee calculator is needed when a customer is ready with their shopping cart and weâ€™d like to show them how much the delivery will cost. The delivery price depends on the cart value, the number of items in the cart, the time of the order, and the delivery distance.

No ChatGPT was used during the development process!
